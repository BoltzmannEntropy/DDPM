## Preface

Since the latter part of 2022, the term Generative Artificial Intelligence, or GenAI, has woven itself into the fabric of our daily discussions. Despite its frequent usage, a clear and precise definition of GenAI often remains elusive. Many discussions simply refer to well-known systems like ChatGPT or **Stable Diffusion, a distinguished DDPM model**, as examples of the concept. This raises the question: Is the absence of a precise definition a reflection of its perceived irrelevance, or are there other reasons behind this conceptual vagueness? Furthermore, are there prevailing misunderstandings in our discussions about GenAI, and if so, what contributes to the confusion surrounding diffusion and other models?

Upon deeper analysis, it becomes evident that GenAI is often used as a catch-all term, primarily by laypeople or academics from fields such as philosophy, to broadly classify this burgeoning area of technology. This suggests that the term is less about identifying specific technologies or methods, and more about capturing a general sense of the field. **However, it is important to note that in this book, our focus is specifically on diffusion models**. We do not address the wider scope of GenAI, instead concentrating on providing a thorough understanding of diffusion models alone.

This textbook is expertly crafted for **graduate students** in physics and computer science, offering a semester-long, thorough exploration of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) within the expansive field of generative AI. Unlike conventional texts that follow a rigid definition-theorem-proof format, **this book adopts a more relaxed and conversational tone**, incorporating extensive commentary, motivation, and explanations to enhance understanding and engagement.

## Educational Goals

**Rich with a vast array of fully solved examples and exercises** of varying complexity, this manuscript integrates these into the narrative to enhance and assess the reader's understanding extensively. **These exercises are central to the book's structure**, often referenced in subsequent discussions to encourage a dynamic and interactive learning environment.

Inspired by the **renowned Schaum's Outline series**, the text marries rigorous theoretical exposition with practical applications. This methodology is crafted to reinforce theoretical knowledge through **hands-on problem-solving**, thereby enhancing comprehension.

## Methodological Approach

While the primary focus is theoretical, the text occasionally incorporates code snippets to bridge the gap between theory and practical application, making it ideal for graduate students and professionals committed to mastering diffusion models.

Each section of each chapter is organized to include:
1. An introduction to the concepts,
2. Relevant definitions and theorems,
3. Problems and detailed solutions.

## Programming Mini-Projects

To enhance the pedagogical value of each chapter and solidify the theoretical concepts presented, the text concludes with a series of practical programming projects. These projects are designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling readers to apply their newly acquired knowledge in simulated environments. This hands-on approach not only reinforces understanding but also sharpens practical skills essential for advancing in the field of generative AI.

The projects include:
- **1D Simulation of Brownian Motion:** Engage with the fundamental stochastic process by simulating particle movements in a fluid, mimicking the random motion observed by Robert Brown.
- **Forward Diffusion Simulation:** Develop a program to model the progressive addition of noise to a system, illustrating how data evolves into a more chaotic state over time.
- **Backward Diffusion Simulation:** Implement the reverse of the forward diffusion process, demonstrating techniques to recover the original data from its noised state.
- **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process Simulation:** Simulate this mean-reverting stochastic process, commonly used to model interest rates and other financial indicators.
- **Core Denoising Probabilistic Model (DPM) Development:** Construct a basic version of a denoising model to understand the foundational mechanics and algorithms that drive these systems.
- **Full Realization of a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM):** Build a comprehensive DDPM to explore its application in generating high-quality synthetic data.
- **Sampling Algorithms Implementation:** Create and test various sampling algorithms that play a crucial role in generating outputs from trained models.

These projects encourage a deep dive into the practical aspects of stochastic processes and diffusion models, preparing readers to tackle real-world problems and innovate within the domain of generative AI.
